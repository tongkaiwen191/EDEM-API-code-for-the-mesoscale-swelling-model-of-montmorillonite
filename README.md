# EDEM-API-code-for-the-mesoscale-swelling-model-of-montmorillonite
In this code, a self-defined mesoscale montmorillonite swelling model was added on the basis of the built-in EEPA contact model of EDEM. Based on the Visual Studio 2019 software, the dynamic link library (DLL) file that can be loaded and run by the EDEM software was generated through C++ language.
